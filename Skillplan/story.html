		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Hello SkillPlan team!</p>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to look at my application. On this page you will find two versions of a demo of an eLearning course for your "Six Steps to Mentoring" workshop. </p>
        <p>Although I am not familiar with this workshop myself, I was able to locate resources for this workshop on your website, YouTube, and through a google search. </p>
        <p>I apologize in advance for any copyright I may have infringed on for these demos.</p>
        
        <h2>HTML5 Version</h2>
        <p>This version was created to demonstrate my technical skills using HTML5 and CSS. It is packaged as a SCORM file which can be uploaded to any LMS.</p>
