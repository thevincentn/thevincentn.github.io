		<h1>Overview</h1>
		<p>Hello SkillPlan team!</p>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to look at my application. On this page you will find a two versions of a demo of an eLearning course for your "Six Steps to Mentoring" workshop. In addition, you'll also find a demo of a numeracy lesson on adding fractions for the trades.</p>
        <p>Although I am not familiar with this workshop myself, I was able to locate resources for this workshop on your website, YouTube, and through a google search. </p>
        <p>I apologize in advance for any copyright I may have infringed on for these demos.</p>
        
        <h1>Numeracy for the Trades: Adding Fractions</h1>
		<p>This module was created using Articulate Rise. It highlights some basic numeracy skills relating to adding fractions. Included in the course is a video I created using Google Sketchup and Camtasia.</p>
