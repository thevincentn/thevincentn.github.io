		Often, when viewing news broadcasts, we bring a personal bias toward the source of the news and the broadcasters, which can alter our analysis of the information. 
		<br>
		In isolation, we can typically recognize bias in the media and critically analyze what is being presented to us. However, when we repeatedly view the same sources for our news, whether it be Fox News, CNN, CNBC, The BBC, The CBC, etc. we can lose that critical eye. 
		<br>
		By recreating these broadcasts we hope to shift the focus toward the content of the broadcast, and away from the source.
