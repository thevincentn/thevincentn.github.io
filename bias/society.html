		<h1>Implicit bias in Society</h1>
		<h3>Watch the following videos. Think about how you feel watching each video and what thoughts come into your mind. 
		<br>Do you agree with the study discussed in the article? 
	<br>Do you think that the female authors of the Study come into with an over estimate of the Gender Wage Gap or do you think that if the authors were male they would have been overly dismissive of the gender discrimination? 
<br>Do you believe that implicit bias made the other prisoners react the way they did in the second video?</h3>
