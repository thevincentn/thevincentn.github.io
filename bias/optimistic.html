				<h3>
			“A person who is inclined to practical optimism; a person who looks on the bright side of things, and is disposed, with or without sufficient reason, to interpret situations favourably.” (<a href="https://www-oed-com.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/view/Entry/132074?redirectedFrom=optimist+#eid"> Oxford Dictionary</a>) 
				<br><br>
	When we look for the best we see the best. This is how we should teach our students. While constructive criticism is necessary, we need to focus on building the confidence of our students. Celebrating success will create a classroom that students look forward to attending and give their best effort.
