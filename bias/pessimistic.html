		<h2>
			“A person who is inclined to pessimism; a person who habitually takes an unhopeful or the worst views of things, or who interprets circumstances, the future etc. unfavourably; a person who holds a philosophical doctrine of pessimism. Contrasted with optimism.” (<a href="https://www-oed-com.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/view/Entry/141728?redirectedFrom=pessimist#eid"> Oxford Dictionary</a>)

			When taking a quiz it becomes apparent if you expect the worst in the world (a sample not definitive), which is understandable in today’s society.This may be based on personal experience and/or relation to the world. The news outlets make money off doom and gloom; however, not everything is bad. When observing the world through a negative lens, hate can breed hate and nothing gets better, except for maybe metal music and poetry.
