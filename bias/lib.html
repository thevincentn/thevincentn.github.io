		<h1>Liberal Newscast</h1>
		<h3>This Liberal  perspective of the news was broadcasted by CBC news in August 2019.  While watching the news we often naturally check our sources and give our own unconscious judgments about these sources. (<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/do-video-games-cause-violence-expert-says-playing-violent-video-games-does-not-make-you-a-mass-shooter/">CBSNews Article</a>)
		<br><br>
		In isolation, we can typically recognize bias in the media and critically analyze what is being presented to us. However, when we repeatedly view the same sources for our news, whether it be Fox News, CNN, CNBC, The BBC, The CBC, etc. we can lose that critical eye. 
		<br><br>
		By recreating these broadcasts we hope to shift the focus toward the content of the broadcast, and away from the source.
