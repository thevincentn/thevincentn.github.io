		<h1>Implicit Bias in Society</h1>
		<h3>Implicit bias also affects how people act with people different from themselves. We have all seen that in spite of their conscious feelings, white people with high levels of implicit racial bias show less warmth and welcoming behavior toward black people. But we do not always acknowledge that people show implicit bias towards women in the workplace with regards to wages. The first video backs up the premise that there still exists a Gender wage Gap in Canada using data collected over decades.  The second video is an example of the bias that has existed through the ages, while done in a funny manner, it does indeed speak to the truth of how long the wage gap has existed.
