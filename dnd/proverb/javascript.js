Let fortune shift the scene, and make the poor man rich, he runs at once into the vice that he declaimed against so feelingly; these are strange contradictions in the human character.

',' Friedrich Nietzsche In fact, arrogance is kind of key to artistry — believing that you’re so brilliant that you deserve the right to tell a story.

',' Frank Lloyd Wright Nothing is so unpalatable to arrogant people as to meet with scorn where they expected an unqualified admission of superiority.

',' Author Unknown Arrogance is an utterly appropriate weapon to use against a hostile world, a world in which arrogance is feared and respected, even if, like mine, it’s only feigned. ',' Thomas Bernhard Arrogance is the crass second nature of moneybags. ',' Ebere Wabara Arrogance in celebrities is like bright petals on a nectarless flower. They make them become larger than life and grudgingly desirable. Their respect value rises, and people who have to deal with them on a professional level accord them the most respect and reverence.

They invest their energies in maintaining a cozy feeling of complacency, and complacency is the biggest single enemy to the process of continuously learning from experience.

However, yank the external support system away, and the person’s sense of self-worth goes with it. ',' Derek Whitney Arrogance is a self-defense tactic to disguise insecurities. ',' Caroll Michels Arrogance boasts of itself. Humility does not. Arrogance provides a false sense of identity for its wearer. True humility positively contributes to one’s true identity.

',' Lisa Gardner Pride (which is to say, arrogance) is sometimes held to be the worst of the sins and I think I agree, since so much vice and bad judgment flow from the prideful. ',' Rod Smith Arrogance is a double edged sword. More often than not it subsumes the personalities to self-destruction as they lack the power of self-discrimination and self-examination. ',' Ravi Valluri Arrogance is only bad when you lose. If you are winning and you are arrogant then it is self-belief. ',' Eddie Jones Usually arrogance is a mask for a lack of confidence. People who lack confidence may display arrogance as a way of compensating for the way they feel. ',' Jay Carter & Bobbi Dempsy The fragile line between confidence and arrogance is humility. ',' Norman E. Bowie & Meg Schneider Because arrogance is born in personal vanity, arrogant people are driven without mercy. They can never get enough power to fill the soul’s needs or enough respect to overcome the fear that they deserve less than they are getting. ',' Lewis B. Smedes Modesty is only arrogance by stealth. ',' Terry Pratchett Confidence is a nice suit. Arrogance is the same suit with suspenders, Italian loafers, and gold cuff links. ',' Tim Schneider Arrogance is not strength. Arrogance is just another mask for fear. ',' Bruce Duffy Arrogance is the twin of a more noble impulse … a profound certainty that often yields wonderful results. ',' Matt Vella Arrogance is in everything I do. It is in my gestures, the harshness of my voice, in the glow of my gaze, in my sinewy, tormented face. ',' Coco Chanel Arrogance is a veneer — a thin covering of excuses hiding deep performance deficiencies. ',' Bob Lewis Arrogance is, as it were, a solicitation on the part of one seeking honor for followers, whom he thinks he is entitled to treat with contempt.
